**Josiah Stadler**
*"Currently a senior at UNCG completing a Computer Science degree with a concentration in Data Science. In my past career I was exposed to various new applications that allowed me to do my job more effectively. Some of these applications worked well and others fell short. This got me interested in exploring ways to bridge the gap between developers and end users."*

  *"I am a senior Computer Science major with a concentration in Data Science. I fell in love with data after I took a class in Machine Learning. I have always loved math and statistics, so I figured computer science would be a good field for me. Aside from school, I enjoy playing with my dog, Joel, and improving my art skills."*
