# Peer-to-Peer Delivery Java Application

A Java application designed to facilitate the delivery of large items using a peer-to-peer model, similar to Uber. The project demonstrates MVC architecture, secure database interactions, and API integration.

### Key Features:
- **Peer-to-Peer Delivery**: Implements a model for users to request and offer delivery services, optimizing the transportation of large items.
- **MVC Architecture**: Showcases a well-structured Model-View-Controller architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Secure Database Interactions**: Employs best practices for secure database connections and transactions, protecting user data and ensuring integrity.
- **API Integration**: Integrates with third-party APIs to enhance functionality, such as mapping services and payment processing.

### Getting Started:
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Peer-to-Peer-Delivery.git`
2. **Set up the database**: Configure your database settings in `application.properties` and initialize the schema.
3. **Build and run the application**: Use your preferred IDE or the command line with `mvn clean install` and `java -jar target/delivery-app.jar`.

### Future Enhancements:
- Expansion of the user interface with more detailed delivery tracking features.
- Addition of machine learning algorithms to optimize delivery routes.
- Development of mobile app counterparts for iOS and Android platforms.
